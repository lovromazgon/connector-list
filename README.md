# Conduit Connector List

This repo contains a script that crawls GitHub and creates the file `connectors.json` with all connectors and their releases.

The script expects the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) to be installed as well as the extension [gh-dependents](https://github.com/otiai10/gh-dependents).
